    <h1> Olivia Mulholland Salazar</h1>
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
      Olivia (she/her) has a Bachelor of Arts in History from the University of Washington, where she honed her skills in dynamic analysis and interpretation 
      through research; communication and presentation; and critical thinking and problem solving. During the last ten years she has built and maintained her own 
      child and house care business, working regularly with at least seven families at a time. She took her passion for competitive swimming and water polo back 
      to the teams she played with in her youth by working as a coach for Rain City Water Polo and Eastside Aquatic Swim Team. After working as a Lead Twos Teacher 
      at Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Olivia went on to work for El Centro de la Raza, a non-profit that works as a voice and hub for Latino communities in 
      the Greater Seattle Area. There she worked as the Job Developer for El Centro's Youth Job Readiness Training program, helping Latino students at Seattle World 
      School prepare for post-secondary work and/or education. She also acted as the case manager and coordinator for the Bebes! HOPE program, which works in 
      conjunction with King County Public Health to reduce infant mortality in vulnerable populations. 
    </p>    
    <p>Olivia's interest in software development stems from her love of languages. She grew up speaking English and Spanish at home, studied Mandarin Chinese and 
      American Sign Language in school, and High Valyrian from Game of Thrones in her free-time. She plans to bring her extensive experience working with diverse 
      groups of people, and her passion for languages, to the workplace in order to collaboratively create tools and services that will enact meaningful change in 
      the lives of many.
