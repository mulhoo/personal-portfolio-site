  <h1> Olivia (Liv) Mulholland Salazar</h1>
  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>
    I have a Bachelor of Arts in History from the University of Washington, where I honed my skills in dynamic analysis and interpretation 
    through research; communication and presentation; and critical thinking and problem solving. During the last ten years I have built and maintained my own 
    child and house care business, working regularly with at least seven families at a time. I took my passion for competitive swimming and water polo back 
    to the teams I played with in my youth by working as a coach for Rain City Water Polo and Eastside Aquatic Swim Team. After working as a Lead Twos Teacher 
    at Bright Horizons Family Solutions, I went on to work for El Centro de la Raza, a non-profit that works as a voice and hub for Latino communities in 
    the Greater Seattle Area. There I worked as the Job Developer for El Centro's Youth Job Readiness Training program, helping Latino students at Seattle World 
    School prepare for post-secondary work and/or education. I also acted as the case manager and coordinator for the Bebes! HOPE program, which works in 
    conjunction with King County Public Health to reduce infant mortality in vulnerable populations. 
  </p>    
  <p>My interest in software development stems from my love of languages. I grew up speaking English and Spanish at home, studied Mandarin Chinese and 
    American Sign Language in school, and learned High Valyrian from Game of Thrones in my free-time. I plan to bring my extensive experience working with diverse 
    groups of people, and my passion for languages, to the workplace in order to collaboratively create tools and services that will enact meaningful change in 
    the lives of many.
